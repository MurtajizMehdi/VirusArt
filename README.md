# VirusArt
This is a simple Python project using the Turtle library. The graphic is supposed to represent a virus up close and how it's usually represented in TV shows or on the news. 

I plan on making more digital desgins with Python Turtle, especially since I see it more as a hobby while still being intact with programming.
Any and all recommendations/suggestions are welcome!!
